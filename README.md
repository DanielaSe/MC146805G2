# MC146805G2

https://www.70cd555.com

Source code for an AT1284P to replace the MC146805G2 tape deck CPU in the Philips 70CD555 Sound Machine produced from 1986

Programming of the cassette is slightly different to the original since the interface was not user friendly. To use with the replacement PCB. Revision B in progress and get published soon.

The project is still in progress and far away from beeing a pretty code due to time issues. Use at your own risk.
